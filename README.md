# Jammming
Jammming is a web-based music platform that allows users to search for songs, create playlists, and save them to their Spotify accounts. This README provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, technologies used, features, and future work.

## Purpose

The purpose of building this project is to provide users with a seamless and interactive experience for discovering and organising music. It leverages the Spotify Web API to search for songs based on user input, display search results, and enable the creation and management of personalized playlists.

## Technologies Used

Jammming is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Used for structuring.
- **CSS**: Used for styling.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for implementing functionality and interactivity.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Spotify Web API**: Provides access to Spotify's music catalogue, allowing search functionality and playlist management.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking and managing changes to software code.

## Features

Jammming offers the following key features:

* **Search**: Users can enter a song, album, or artist in the search bar to retrieve relevant search results from the Spotify catalogue.

* **Search Results**: The application displays the search results, including track information such as name, artist, and album. Users can browse through the results and select tracks to add to their playlists.

* **Playlist Management**: Users can create and manage personalized playlists by adding or removing tracks from the displayed search results. The playlist dynamically updates as tracks are added or removed.

* **Save to Spotify**: Users can save a playlist directly to their Spotify accounts using the "Save to Spotify" button once a playlist is created or modified. This feature requires authentication and authorization with Spotify.

## Future Work

Jammming has the potential for further enhancements and improvements. Here are some ideas for future work:

* **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and user-specific playlists to provide a personalized experience.

* **Playlist Collaboration**: Enable users to share and collaborate on playlists with other users, allowing for collaborative music discovery and curation.

* **Additional Music Services**: Integrate with other music streaming services, such as Apple Music or Deezer, to offer a wider range of music options for users.

* **Advanced Search Filters**: Expand the search functionality to include advanced filters, such as genre, release date, or popularity, to provide more refined search results.

* **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the user interface and user experience through enhanced visual design, responsive layout, and intuitive interactions.

* **Offline Mode**: Implement offline support, allowing users to access their saved playlists and listen to music even when not connected to the internet.

These are just a few possibilities for future development, and the project can be expanded and customised based on specific requirements and user feedback.

## Conclusion

Jammming offers an attractive and practical solution for music enthusiasts to search, create, and manage their playlists effortlessly. With the use of modern web technologies and integration with the Spotify Web API, it provides a seamless music discovery and organization experience. Feel free to explore and contribute to the project to make it even better!
